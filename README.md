# Base64-Tools
This tool gives the capability to encode and decode strings in Base64.

The user is asked to decide whether to encode or decode, to provide the string, and whether the results should be printed or output to a text file ("results.txt") which appears in the directory that the program runs in. Input is not case-sensitive.

todo: add capability to encode and decode entire files
